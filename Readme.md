# FAQ

## How can I use these profiles?

Many of these profiles are using the XWA txt file, so download the profile of your choice, open the launcher and run the Joystick Configurator. Select `Open` in the top right and then you can import the txt file you just downloaded and then `Save`. Advanced configurations (e.g `.cms`, `.pr0` files) may require a vendor software to be installed of your Joystick brand. You can find more details / tutorials within the Readme files provided for each Joystick.  

## How can I fix my endless roll / spinning?
First, make sure to disable the `Rudder` in the in-game menu which can be accessed by pressing `ESC` key. Using the Joystick Configurator, you can also modify the axis controls or even bind an axis to a non-existent controller ID in the joystick configurator to stop some rolling or spinning issues. If you for some reason don't have a joystick or even a controller, the game can even be controlled purely by keyboard and mouse. To do this, use the `Babu Frik Configurator` to turn on joystick emulation and set the mouse sensitivity.

## The hat buttons on my XXXX brand Joystick is acting weird. Instead of 1 click = 1 input, it just keeps spamming and repeats my input.

Enable the checkbox that says "Use the POV as regular buttons” in the Settings tab of Joystick Configurator. 

## Some profile / mapping is not working or not to my liking at all!

Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately it's impossible for us to verify each and every profile, so we require your help on this. If you have issues with the configuration provided or want to submit/update a joystick/controller profile, you can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GFVjySqEfm) and post in the `#joysticks-and-controllers` channel and ask for help from the community.

## Sometimes my joystick behaves really weird, I can't stay on target!

You may notice when looking at the 'poles' of the skybox map, you will find you're suddenly fighting the game in keeping on target, almost like two magnets repelling each other when you try to bring them together. This is due to a game engine issue that is present in all the X-Wing/TIE Fighter series of games which is essentially some form of gimbal lock. Without understanding how and where in the code of the EXE this issue occurs, it is not possible at this time for us to fix it or even if it’s fixable at all.

## This looks awesome, where can I get more info about this mod?
