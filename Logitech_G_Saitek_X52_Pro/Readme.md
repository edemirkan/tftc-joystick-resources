4. `x52 pro US Keyboard with All Functions Mapped.pr0` - submitted by [MEDumont](https://github.com/MEDumont)

    This US Keyboard includes mappings for power management, targeting, launching/docking, power management, UI Manipulation, and labels so all of those actions will light up on your display when the button is pressed. It should work with both X52 and X52 Pros, both the Saitek and Logitech variants.

    **NOTE:** This mapping requires all mappings in XWA to be removed except for the primary fire button.
